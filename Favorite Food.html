		<h1>Sushi</h1>
        <p>Sushi is a food that is made of multiple pieces of food.</p>
        
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
			<li>5 sheets nori.</li>
			<li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
			<li>2 ounces sushi-grade tuna, cut into1/4 by 1/2 by 3-inch strips</li>
			<li>1 hot house cucumber, julienne</li>
            <li>1 carrot, peeled and julienne</li>
            <li>1/2 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
        <ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
				<li>Place a nori sheet lengthwise on a bamboo rolling mat, shiny-side down.</li>
				<li>Position the sheet about 1-inch from the edge of the mat closest to you and leave some of the bamboo mat exposed on either side of the nori sheet.</li>
				<li>Wet your hands in cool water and take a handful of sushi rice.</li>
				<li>Place the rice in the center of the nori and use your fingers to spread the rice evenly over the nori.</li>
				<li>Be sure to leave a 3/4-inch strip of nori uncovered on the far side.</li>
				<li>Place tuna strips and some julienne vegetable, cucumber or avocado along the center of the rice.</li>
				<li>Be careful not to overfill the nori. Place your fingertips over the fillings to hold them in place.</li>
				<li>Then, use your thumbs to lift up the edge of the bamboo rolling mat closest to you.</li>
				<li>Begin rolling the mat away from you, while applying pressure to the fillings to keep the roll firm.</li>
				<li>Roll the mat over slowly until it covers the rice and the near and far sides of rice join, still leaving the 3/4-inch strip of nori, rice-free, exposed.</li>
				<li>While holding the bamboo mat in position, apply pressure to the roll with your fingers to make the roll firm.</li>
				<li>Slice the roll in half, then cut both rolls twice to make 6 equal sized pieces.</li>
				<li>Repeat this process with the salmon and various fillings, nori and rice.</li>
